27.09.23 - Added the template code for basic socket programming in java language, further on I ll be modifiying these server and client applications according the assignment.
29.09.23 - Modified applications in such way that now you give port numbers to Servers at the start of the application and and give 3 of the portnumbers to client in the same way. Client then enters the values and application sends those values to random servers. There is some error occuring in the code. I suspect its because of the inappropriate close of the Servers. Tomorrow I will collect all connections to sockets in an array and shut them all once.
30.09.23 - As I documented yesterday, I did update the code that know I create the connections and collect them in array beforehand then use them. The problem for yesterday's errors was that when Client typed "Over" which is eliminating string for the application. It only send the message the current server that its connected to. Now whenever client application sees "Over" it sends string to all servers and closes all connections.
